     <p>No matter what season, the chances are good that the answer to the question "What's for dinner?" is going to be "Soup!"<br><br>

        It may be the answer on a cold and chilly day, or just when you have no other ideas for dinner and need something fast and easy. Soup is warm, comforting, and always delicious.</p>
     <h1> Ingredients</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>1 to 1 1/3 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup diced yellow onion (from 1 small onion or 1/2 large onion)</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, diced</li>
        <li>1 sweet bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine, optional</li>
        <li>1 cup elbow macaroni, optional</li>
    
     </ul>

     <h1> Steps </h1>
     <ol>
        <li><p><h3>Brown the beef in a heavy stock pot:</h3>
            In a large Dutch oven or stock pot over medium heat, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Break it apart with a wooden spoon into large chunks.<br><br>
            
            When browned, use a slotted spoon to transfer the ground beef onto a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Set it aside.<br><br><img src="/images/1.webp"></li><br></p><br>
        <li><h3>Cook the vegetables:</h3>
            Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat from the ground beef (or add enough olive oil to make 1 tablespoon if there's not much fat).<br><br>
            
            Add the diced onion, celery, carrot and bell pepper and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes.<br><img src="/images/1.webp"></li><br><br>
        <li><h3>The seasonings, tomatoes, and broth:</h3>
            Stir in the tomato paste and garlic, and cook about 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add in the oregano, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.<br><br>

            Stir in the diced tomatoes, beef broth, and red wine (if using). Lastly, add the cooked ground beef back to the pan. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.<br><br><img src="/images/1.webp"></li><br>
        <li><h4>The soup:</h4>
            Bring the soup to a rapid simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and cook for about 20 more minutes. If you are adding elbow macaroni, add it halfway through simmering, and cook until the pasta is tender.<br><br><img src="/images/1.webp"></li><br>
        <li><h3>Serve immediately:</h3>
            Dole the soup out into individual bowls and serve hot from the pot. Leftovers will keep up to 5 days refrigerated, or up to 3 months frozen.</li>
