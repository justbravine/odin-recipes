    <h2>CHICKEN OVER RICE RECIPE</h2>
    <P> Like many memorable New York City adventures, my first foray into the city's famous street food, chicken and rice, ensued very early in the morning, a 2 AM stop after a night out visiting my friend at Columbia. <br><br>

        The radiant glow of an unpretentious street cart on an otherwise dark street drew us in. Our stomachs famished from a night of dancing, we devoured the plate of saucy chicken and golden rice.<br><br><img src="/images/COR1.webp"> <br><br>
        
        After leaving New York, I was eager to create a recipe to enjoy the iconic flavors at home. And while many of us may have relished it as a late-night snack, it's equally as delicious to enjoy throughout the week.<br><br> </P>

    <h3>METHOD</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4><li>Marinate the chicken:</h4>
            <br><img src="/images/COR3.webp"><br>
            In a large bowl, whisk lemon juice, oil, garlic, salt, oregano, coriander, allspice, cumin, and black pepper until combined. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 to 4 hours.<br><br><img src="/images/COR4.webp"></li><br>
        <h4><li>Soak the rice: </h4>
            Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh sieve, combing through the grains with your fingers, until water appears almost clear, about 1 minute. 
            
            Transfer rice to a medium bowl, and add enough cold water to submerge the grains completely. Soak for at least 30 minutes up to 4 hours.</li><br>
            
        <h4><li>Make the white sauce: </h4>
            In a medium bowl, whisk yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, sugar, garlic, and black pepper until smooth. Add 1 to 3 tablespoons of water, as needed, until the sauce is drizzleable but not watery. 
            
            Taste, and adjust for salt as needed. 
            
            The sauce should taste creamy, slightly tangy, and well-seasoned. Optionally, add in sugar if necessary to balance the flavors.<br><br><img src="/images/COR5.webp"></li><br>
        <h4><li>Cook the rice: </h4>
            Drain the rice through a sieve and set aside until ready to cook.
            
            Set a large sauce pot over medium heat and melt butter with cardamom. Saute the diced shallots for 5 to 6 minutes until mostly softened. Stir in turmeric and saute for 1 minute until the mixture turns bright yellow. 
            
            Add the rice, chicken stock, and salt, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and cook for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off, then let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes before fluffing with a fork.<br><br><img src="/images/COR6.webp"></li><br>
        <h4><li>Cook the chicken thighs</h4>
            Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large cast-iron skillet or saute pan set over medium heat. 
            
            Cooking in batches, carefully add chicken to the skillet with tongs and cook on one side for 5 to 6 minutes until nicely browned. Flip the chicken, and cook on the other side for 5 to 6 minutes until fully cooked. A thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should register at least 165°F (I prefer a temperature of 175°F to 180°F for a more tender texture).
            <br><br><img src="/images/COR7.webp"><br><br>
            Transfer to a plate or cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batches. Once rested, cut the chicken into 1/3-inch to 1/2-inch strips.<br><br><img src="/images/C0R8.webp"></li><br>
        <h4><li>Assemble</h4>
            To assemble, divide rice amongst serving bowls and top with chicken, tomato, lettuce, a generous white sauce drizzle and a squeeze of red sauce. Serve with warm pita. 
            
            Storage Instructions: Leftover chicken and white sauce can be stored in separate airtight containers in the fridge for 2 to 3 days. Leftover rice can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 to 4 days.<br><br><img src="/images/C0R9.webp"> </li>
